# Sorting-Methods
An assignment I completed in college, fall 2017. The goal was to use Java to display the operations of several different sorting algorithms by generating a random list of integers for each algorithm, and displaying the sorted results.

This was to be done by means of a "driver class", that would generate lists, run them through the algorithms, and display the sorted results.

The algorithms required to be used were:
	• Bubble sort
	• Heap sort
	• Insertion sort
	• Merge sort
	• Quick sort
	• Radix sort
 	• Selection sort
	• Shell sort
