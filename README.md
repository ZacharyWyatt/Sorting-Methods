# Sorting-Methods
This program can be compiled with the [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/). Once installed, one would open Netbeans, click "file" then "Open Project", and select the folder containing the program. Then, one would select "Run", or hit the F6 key.

Individual Java files can be viewed under Sorting_Methods/Sorting Methods/src/wyatt/zachary/lab/pkg8/

Is program uses Java to display the operations of several different sorting algorithms by generating a random list of integers for each one, and displaying the sorted results. I completed this project in fall 2017. 

This was to be done by means of a "driver class", that would generate lists, run them through the algorithms, and display the sorted results.

The algorithms required to be used were:
	• Bubble sort
	• Heap sort
	• Insertion sort
	• Merge sort
	• Quick sort
	• Radix sort
 	• Selection sort
	• Shell sort
